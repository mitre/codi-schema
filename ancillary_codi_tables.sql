/*
  For CODI at North Carolina
  Updated September, 14, 2021 from CODI at Colorado.
	1. Commented out IDENTIFIER tables, to be removed.
	2. Added SDOH_INDICATOR, HOUSEHOLD_LINK to the CODI schema
	3. Added PRIVATE_ADDRESS_HISTORY, PRIVATE_DEMOGRAPHIC to the CDM schema
		Assuming CDM schema is already created.
